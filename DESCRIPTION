Description: An implementation of
        the representation-dependent gene level operations of grammar-based
        genetic programming with genes which are derivation trees
        of a context-free grammar: Initialization of a gene with a 
        complete random derivation tree, decoding of a derivation tree.
        Crossover is implemented by exchanging subtrees. Depth-bounds
        for the minimal and the maximal depth of the roots of the subtrees
        exchanged by crossover can be set. 
        Mutation is implemented by replacing a subtree by a random subtree. 
        The depth of the random subtree and the insertion node are 
        configurable. For details, 
        see Geyer-Schulz (1997, ISBN:978-3-7908-0830-X).
